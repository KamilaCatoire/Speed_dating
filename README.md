# Speed_dating
Explore a dataset derived from a speed dating experiment conducted between 2002 and 2004. During these events, participants engaged in brief "first dates" with every member of the opposite sex. Subsequently, they were asked to express their interest in seeing their date again and to rate their date on six attributes: attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests. The dataset also encompasses questionnaire data collected from participants at various stages of the process.

The notebook should encompass:

 -   Descriptive statistics
 -   Visualizations
 -   Captions and interpretations highlighting the relevance of these factors in influencing individuals' decisions to accept or decline a second date.
